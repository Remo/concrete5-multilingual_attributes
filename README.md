concrete5 Multilingual attributes
=================================

This concrete5 package introduces a new attribute type that can handle multilingual values. You can specify a text (single-line or multi-line) or a html code for each language installed in the website, and final users will see the value associated to their language.

It's mainly useful for file attributes (for instance you'll be able to localize titles and/or descriptions) and for pages that are not under the control of the multilingual package.

You can easily help translating this package in the [Multilingual attributes](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/concrete5-packages/resource/multilingual-attributes/) section of the [Transifex concrete5 packages](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/concrete5-packages/) project.
